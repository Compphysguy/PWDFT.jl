Density vs potential mix

\jlinline{KS_solve_SCF_potmix}

In the mean time, they are separated. They might be combined into one function
in the future development.

Mixing algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
\item Simple or linear mixing
\item Adaptive linear mixing
\item Anderson mixing
\item Broyden mixing
\item Pulay mixing
\item Restarted Pulay mixing
\item Periodic Pulay mixing
\end{itemize}
