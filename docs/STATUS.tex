- **28 May 2018** The following features are working now:
	
  - LDA and GGA, spin-paired and spin polarized calculations
  - Calculation with k-points (for periodic solids). Monkhorst-Pack grid
    generation is done using \texttt{spglib}
  
  Band structure calculation is possible in principle as simply solving
  Schrodinger equation with converged Kohn-Sham potentials, however there
  is currently no tidy script or function to do that.

  Total energy result for isolated systems (atoms and molecules) agrees quite
  well with ABINIT and PWSCF results.

  Total energy result for periodic solid is quite different from ABINIT and PWSCF.
  I suspect that this is related to treatment of electrostatic terms in periodic system.

  SCF is quite shaky for several systems, however it is working in quite well in nonmetallic
  system.
